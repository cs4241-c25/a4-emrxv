# Fitness Tracker 4000

## Glitch Link: https://a4-emre-sunar.glitch.me/

This project is a fitness tracking web application that allows users to log, update, and delete workouts which I used for assignments 2 and 3. It allows users to log in using GitHub OAuth for authentication with Passport. I transported the directory into React and I kept the Express and MongoDB backend. For styling, I continued to use TailwindCSS. I split up the workout log and managed it using a set of React components such as `LoginForm.js` for authentication, `WorkoutForm.js` for adding workouts, `WorkoutLog.js` for showing the entries, and `LogoutButton.js` for handling logouts. There were several challenges that I ran into like CORS not letting me login properly. Authentication states were not persisting initially, so I added fetch("/auth/status") to check the login status and update the UI depending on the status. Updating and deleting workouts needed to be tailored to work with react so that they worked dynamically without requiring a full page reload.
